how did this get lost...

The avra directory (folder for the Amiga folks) is something of a placeholder
at the moment. It is the code from a forked version of avra that actually can
build the AmForth source tree. Bringing it here in this form is sort of like
hacking off a limb and saying, "oh hey, here is your leg" but the proper way
to do this is not quite clear. It is a zero volume repo that can be treated as
static.

What to do?

Mostly I'd like to preserve the history when bringing it in. Me thinks I'll
have to learn how to do the subgit thing (or whatever it is called) to park the
repo in this one.

Right, so, this directory has it's own licence. Respect it, or I'll send
Cartman after you to RESPECT MAI AUTHORITAH! Actually I don't care so much.
Just do what is right whilst I ramble on here.
