##                        **PURGATORY**
---

This will be the listing of the old items from the application project  
until their fates are decided upon. For the most part dropping support  
for boards that are no longer easy to procure may be something that could  
cause issues for those people that still use them. If you see something  
in here that you still use create an issue and I'll look more closely at  
it.

I do think though, that support for the msp430 will be dropped in this  
repo. I have no way to test anything and couldn't find a place to source  
even the chip alone. For now though, the builds will reside here out of  
the main part of the appl directory.
